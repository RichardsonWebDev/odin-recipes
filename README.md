# odin-recipes

This is my first project assigned by the odin-project, which is about my favorite recipes, their ingredients and instructions on how to prepare them. So far I have created the structure of several pages via HTML and added several HTML elements to them. Next up, I will be styling them as I make my way through CSS foundations.
