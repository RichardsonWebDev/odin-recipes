    <h2>All There is to Know about Buffalo Wings</h2>
    <p>Buffalo wings are a popular dish in American cuisine that typically consists of a chicken wing section (either a flat or drumette) that is not breaded and is deep-fried before being coated or dipped in a sauce made with cayenne pepper hot sauce and melted butter. This dish is typically served hot and accompanied by celery and carrot sticks with blue cheese dressing or, in most parts of the US, ranch dressing for dipping. Despite the name, Buffalo wings have no connection to the animal and are actually named after Buffalo, New York, where they were first created. They are often referred to simply as wings, hot wings, or chicken wings.</p>
