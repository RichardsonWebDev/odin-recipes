    <h3 class="heading">For the Pasta</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound penne pasta</li>
        <li>3 bell peppers, preferably a mix of colors, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>4 green onions, sliced, plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>¼ cup jerk seasoning</li>
        <li>2 fresh thyme sprigs</li>
        <li>1 Scotch bonnet pepper, pierced, not sliced (optional)</li>
        <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>¼ cup vegetable or chicken stock</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesean</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="heading">Steps</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the chicken: In a medium bowl, combine jerk seasoning, 1 tablespoon olive oil, garlic powder and smoked paprika. Add chicken and toss to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let sit in the refrigerator for 2 hours or up to 24 hours. Pull chicken out about 1 hour before cooking, so it comes to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Heat oven to 400 degrees. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a cast-iron skillet over medium. Add the chicken to the skillet, and sear chicken on both sides until browned, about 3 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Once chicken is seared, transfer the skillet to the oven and roast chicken until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board, let rest for about 10 minutes, and slice on a bias.</li>
        <li>As chicken roasts, prepare the pasta: Set a pot of well-salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta, and cook according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add 2 tablespoons oil to a heavy pot set over medium, and sauté bell peppers with green onions until peppers are barely softened, about 4 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook until it’s fragrant, about another minute.</li>
        <li>Add the ¼ cup jerk seasoning to the pot and combine. Add the thyme and pierced pepper. Add heavy cream and vegetable stock and bring to a simmer. Mix in the Parmesan, then add pasta.</li>
        <li>Top with the jerk chicken, and garnish with green onions. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
