    <h2>How Rasta Pasta Got Its Name</h2>
    <p>Chef Washington created the dish Rasta Pasta in 1985 at the Paradise Yard Restaurant in Negril, Jamaica. She was preparing a meal for some construction workers and placed ackee on tomato sauce on a bed of homemade fettuccini. The Rasta colors in the dish inspired one of the workers to name it Rasta Pasta. They persuaded Chef Washington to add it to the menu, and it remained on the menu from February 14, 1986, to July 1997.</p>
