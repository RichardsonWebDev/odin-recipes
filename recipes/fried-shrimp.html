    <h2>Seafood Roulette: The Shell-Shocking Fun of Fried Shrimp!</h2>  

    <p>Eating fried shrimp is like playing a game of seafood roulette. One minute you're biting into a succulent, crispy piece of heaven, and the next minute you're crunching down on a piece of shell like a madman. But it's all worth it for those moments of pure bliss, when the flavor explodes in your mouth and you feel like you're on a tropical beach, sipping a Mai Tai and watching the sunset. Plus, you can pretend you're a giant and each shrimp is a tiny boat you're sinking with your teeth!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups Kikkoman Panko Bread Crumbs</li>
        <li>1 pound uncooked jumbo shrimp, peeled and deveined, tails left intact</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Mix flour, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Beat eggs in a second medium bowl until frothy. Place bread crumbs in a third bowl.</li>
        <li>Dredge shrimp in the flour mixture, then shake off excess. Dip shrimp into beaten eggs, then press shrimp into bread crumbs, turning to coat both sides.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 inches oil in a large, heavy pot to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Deep-fry shrimp in batches in the hot oil until cooked through, about 1 minute. Use tongs to transfer shrimp to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat to cook remaining shrimp.</li>
        <li>Arrange shrimp on a platter to serve.</li>
    </ol>
