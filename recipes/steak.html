    <h2>Mmm Steak!</h2>
    <p>Beef steaks are often grilled or fried, and can be cooked to varying degrees of doneness from blue (very rare) to well done. Rare steaks have a soft, cold, red center, while well-done steaks are cooked throughout with no pinkness remaining. Some people enjoy uncooked beef in the form of steak tartare.</p>
