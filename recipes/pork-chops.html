    <h2 class="heading">The Versatile and Barbaric Delight: The Glory of Pork Chops!</h2>

    <p>Pork chops are like the business casual of meats. They're not quite as fancy as a prime rib, but they're not as casual as a hot dog. They're like the khaki pants of meats - versatile, reliable, and always a safe choice for dinner. Plus, they come with their own built-in handle, so you can feel like a barbarian while you eat them.</p>
